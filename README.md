This is my graduation project in C# Web-Development Path in Softuni. It is an web app which allows us to rent a vehicle that we had a dream to drive, or just use it as a daily car, if you can afford it, of couse :)

Application is really easy to run. All you have to do is:

1. Download the ZIP or git-clone it.
2. Open Sln file with Visual Studio.
3. In appSettings.JSON you can change connectionString to database if you want. It is configured to work with local database SQL server. If you have docker or so you should change it to work properly.
4. In pre-seeded data it contains 3 users: Admin, Moderator and usual User: Their Credentials are:
